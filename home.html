Greetings! I am a mid-career digital media professional who has spent the past few years completing my Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree in Computer Science and Information Systems (CSIS) with a specialization in Software Development.
<br><br>
I have completed this Software Portfolio as my final project for the programâ€™s capstone course, CSIS290 - Field Competencies and Employment Strategies. This portfolio showcases the skills I have learned as a student in this program. This includes developing an understanding and competence in <a href="java.html">Java</a>, <a href="javascript.html"> JavaScript</a>, <a href="php.html">PHP</a> and <a href="sql.html">SQL</a>, while cultivating my skills in HTML and CSS, as can be seen in the design of this page and each page on the site. 
<br><br>
I invite you to explore each of these pages, and interact with the code as you please. If you have any feedback, feel free to send it my way at <a href="mailto:S1439555@student.mcckc.edu">S1439555@student.mcckc.edu</a>. <br><br>
