JavaScript was a fun language to learn. As a student learning the language, my focus was on client-side JavaScript programming techniques. As such, I learned how to integrate JavaScript with HTML to bring interactivity to web pages. Examples of this can be found in the <a href="#birthdate">Birth Date program</a>, the <a href="#currentdate">Current Date program</a>, and the <a href="#currentdate">Future Date program</a>. <br> 
<h3><a name="birthdate">Birth Date Program</a></h3>
The following program prompts a user to enter their date of birth, and prints to the screen what day of the week they were born. This program uses variables and operators to execute the code.
<br><br>
In the first step of this program, the user is asked for the year, month, and date in which they were born, as seen below:<br>
<img src="images/javascriptbirthdate1.PNG" alt="Javascript birthdate 1"><br>
<img src="images/javascriptbirthdate2.PNG" alt="Javascript birthdate 2"><br>
<img src="images/javascriptbirthdate3.PNG" alt="Javascript birthdate 3"><br><br>
After all three variables have been entered, the day of the week in which they were born is printed to the screen:<br>
<img src="images/javascriptbirthdate4.PNG" alt="Javascript birthdate 4"><br><br>
I wrote the following code to execute this program:<br>
<pre>
<p class="code">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Birth Date Program&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    
var daysofWeek = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
    
var year = prompt("Enter the year in which you were born: ");
var month = prompt("In numerical format, enter the month in which you were born (a number from 1-12): ");
var date = prompt("Enter the date in which you were born (a number from 1-31): ");

var birthDate = new Date(year, month - 1, date);
    
alert("You were born on a " + (daysofWeek[birthDate.getDay()]));
   
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<h3><a name="currentdate">Current Date Program</a></h3>
In another example, I used the JavaScript Date object to write the current date and time into a web page:<br>
<img src="images/currentdate.PNG" alt="Current date"><br>
I used the following code to execute this program:<br>
<pre>
<p class="code">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Current Date Program&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    
var currentDate = new Date();

document.write("The current date and time is : &lt;br&gt;");
document.write(currentDate);
   
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</p></pre>
<h3><a name="futuredate">Future Date Program</a></h3>
Finally, I used the Date object to calculate the date 12 months from now and write this into a web page:<br>
<img src="images/futuredate.PNG" alt="Future date"><br>
I used the following code to execute this program:<br>
<pre><p class="code">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Future Date Program&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    
var months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", <br>"September", "October", "November", "December"];
    
var futureDate = new Date();
    
futureDate.setMonth(futureDate.getMonth() + 12);
    
document.write("The date 12 months from now is :&lt;br&gt;" + futureDate.getDate());
document.write(" " + months[futureDate.getMonth()]);
document.write(" " + futureDate.getFullYear());

    
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
